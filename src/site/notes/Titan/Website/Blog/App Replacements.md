Below is a chart of the apps I have replaced so far with their self-hosted counterparts. My main motivation for doing so is because I wanted to retain control of my data and protect myself from a service shutting down. One of my main motivators for self-hosting was [Pocket](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket#:~:text=Need%20help%3F-,When%20is%20Pocket%20shutting%20down%3F,data%20will%20be%20permanently%20deleted.) shutting down and [Trakt.tv](https://forums.trakt.tv/t/freemium-experience-more-features-for-all-with-usage-limits/41641) paywalling a lot of the website. Both were services I had been reliant on for years and this sent me searching for a better solution. 

Although it was not a motivator, an added benefit is being able to save some money but elimating some subscriptions. Although it would probably take years to recoup how much it cost to set up Titan in the first place. 

To make it easier to compare, all prices are listed as yearly (unless otherwise specified).

Stay tuned for write ups on each service!
