# Welcome to Ion Drive 
### Launching my self-hosting journey with my first server, Titan

Have you ever started a new hobby and immediately realized you were going to become obsessed with it? That was self-hosting for me. 

I am still very early into my self-hosting journey as I only spun up my first server, [[Titan/Website/Blog/Meet Titan\|Titan]], a few months ago. 

My goal with this website is to document that journey as I continue down the rabbit hole. My main motivation is to have a place to document, in detail, what I learned so that I have a knowledgebase I can refer back to in the future when I inevitably forget how I did something. 

But hopefully this blossoms into something useful for other beginners new to the hobby.
